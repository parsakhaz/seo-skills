# SEO Content Drafting

Create new content based on the approved content strategy. Blog posts, landing
pages, comparison pages, explainer pages, category pages.

**Important**: Run with Claude Opus 4.6.

## Prerequisites

- **Writing process**: Follow `seo-writing-framework` for every piece of content. This is the most important prerequisite. Research real examples, draft with reference, reader hat, edit, run the `good-writing-fundamentals` gate, score.
- **Strategy**: `.seo/strategy.md` should exist from a prior `seo-content-strategy` run.
- **Voice guide**: Must exist in the repo (`AGENTS.md` or `VOICE.md`).

If strategy or voice guide is missing, tell the user to run the prerequisite skill first.

## Goal

Create publication-ready content that:
1. Targets specific keywords from the strategy
2. Matches the founder's voice (reference the voice guide)
3. Includes proper SEO metadata, JSON-LD, and OG images
4. Has author byline with headshot and dates
5. Links to related docs, explainer pages, and glossary terms
6. Includes external authority links for E-E-A-T
7. Passes the humanity test (first-timer can understand it)

## Steps

### 1. Read the strategy and voice guide

Read `.seo/strategy.md` for what to create and why.
Read the voice guide for how to write it.
Identify which content items are approved for creation.

**Success criteria**: Clear list of content to create with target keywords and intent.

### 2. Research each topic

For each piece of content:
- WebSearch the target keyword to see what currently ranks
- Read the top 3 results to understand what the audience expects
- Identify gaps in existing content (what they don't cover)
- Find authoritative sources to reference (E-E-A-T)
- Check if the site has related pages to link to

**Success criteria**: Each topic has research notes, competitive context, and source links.

### 3. Draft content

Write each piece following the site's patterns:
- Match existing component structure (check how other pages are built)
- Use the voice guide for tone and style
- Include proper metadata: title with brand suffix, description with differentiators
- Add JSON-LD schema (Article for blog, FAQPage for FAQ sections, WebPage for landing)
- Create OG image files if the site has a programmatic banner system
- Add AuthorByline component with "Last updated" date
- Use `<Term>` component for glossary words if the site has one

For blog posts:
- Add to the posts array in the correct chronological position
- Set appropriate date (current date or backdated per strategy)
- Include author field

For landing pages:
- Create page.tsx in the appropriate app directory
- Add to footer navigation if it's a primary page
- Add to sitemap if manually maintained
- Check deploy workflows (CI/CD, CDN invalidation, cache purge configs) for per-page entries that new URLs need. Cloud CDN and similar services often require explicit path invalidation for each new trailing-slash URL.

**Success criteria**: Each piece of content is complete with metadata, schema, OG images, byline, and internal/external links.
**Rules**:
- Never keyword-stuff. Write for the reader, optimize for the search engine second.
- Every external link should go to a real, authoritative source
- Titles under 60 characters including brand suffix
- Descriptions include platform/differentiator keywords
- Dates in human-readable format (Month Day, Year)
- No em dashes. Use commas, colons, periods, or sentence breaks.

### 4. Internal linking pass

After all content is drafted, do a linking pass:
- New pages link to relevant existing docs, explainers, and glossary
- Existing pages that mention concepts covered by new pages get links added
- Footer or navigation updated if new pages are primary surfaces
- Footer navigation MUST be updated for new pages. Do not defer this to a separate authority pass. Add compliance pages to the HIPAA Compliance column, alternative pages to a relevant section, and solutions pages to the Solutions column.
- Check if the project has CDN invalidation entries in deploy workflows (e.g., `.github/workflows/*-deploy.yml`) and add entries for every new page URL.
- Glossary updated with any new terms introduced

**Success criteria**: Every new page links to at least 2-3 existing pages. Existing pages link back where relevant.

### 5. Build, verify, deploy

Run the production build to catch errors.
Create a PR with a summary of all content created, target keywords, and the strategy context.

**Success criteria**: Build passes. PR merged or pushed.

### 6. Submit new URLs for indexing

After merge/deploy, submit every new or significantly changed URL for indexing.
Do NOT just list the URLs and leave it to the user. Actually submit them.

**IndexNow** (if configured, look for an IndexNow key file in `public/`):
Submit a batch POST to `https://api.indexnow.org/IndexNow` with the host,
key, keyLocation, and urlList. This covers Bing, Yandex, and feeds into
Google's crawl signals.

**Google Indexing API** (if a GCP service account is configured):
Submit `URL_UPDATED` notifications via `https://indexing.googleapis.com/v3/urlNotifications:publish`.
Limit: ~200/day.

**Fallback** (if neither is configured):
Use the GSC Inspect URL API (via Composio) to inspect each new URL, then
provide the direct GSC inspect links so the user can click "Request Indexing"
manually. Note that the GSC API cannot request indexing programmatically.

**Success criteria**: All new URLs submitted via at least one indexing channel.
Report which channel was used and the response status.

### 7. Record experiments

Record all changes as experiments in `.seo/experiments.md` with:
- What was changed (title, meta description, content, canonical, etc.)
- The baseline metrics from `.seo/data/` at time of change
- Expected impact
- Review date (typically 30 days for title/meta changes, 60-90 days for
  canonical/structural changes)

Commit all `.seo/` changes alongside the content changes and push. Do NOT
leave `.seo/` as local-only files. Never add `.seo/` to `.gitignore`. This
ensures future `/seo-briefing` runs can automatically measure the impact of
content changes.

**Success criteria**: Every content action has an experiment entry with
baseline, expected impact, and review date. `.seo/` is committed and pushed.
**Artifacts**: List of new URLs submitted for indexing, with channel used.
