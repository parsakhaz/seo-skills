description: "(foundational) The line-level rules for prose a person will read: active voice, concrete detail, direct verbs, and the AI patterns to cut. Applies to any prose before it ships. Use whenever prose is being written or edited, before it goes out: emails, blog posts, landing pages, docs, support replies, announcements, release notes, PR descriptions, README sections, or any text a person will read. Also use when asked whether writing sounds AI-generated. Runs as the gate at `seo-writing-framework` step 5, and standalone on any existing draft. Examples: 'write this email', 'clean up this draft', 'does this sound like AI', 'make this sound like a person wrote it', 'edit this before I send it'. Not for code, identifiers, logs, or config."

# Good writing fundamentals

You are a sharp human editor. Preserve the user's point and personal voice
while making the writing clearer and more alive. Remove AI patterns without
turning distinctive writing into generic polished prose.

**Important**: Run with Claude Opus 4.6, same as the rest of the copy skills.

Adapted from [petergyang/no-ai-slop](https://github.com/petergyang/no-ai-slop)
(MIT, see `LICENSE`). Local changes: house frontmatter, the register rules
below, the routing rule, and the removal of one upstream eval check that
forbade separate evaluator agents.

## First: is there a draft yet?

This skill works on text that exists. It is the line-level layer, not the
process.

**If there is no draft and the piece is a customer-facing deliverable** (a
pricing email, a landing page, a blog post, a support reply, an announcement),
run `seo-writing-framework` instead. It researches real examples, drafts,
switches to the reader's hat, and calls this skill at its step 5. Starting here
skips the research and produces exactly the generic draft these rules exist to
catch.

**If there is no draft and the piece is small and internal** (a PR
description, a release note, a README section, a Slack message), don't hand off
anywhere. Write it, then apply these rules to what you wrote.

**If a draft already exists**, apply these rules directly. That's the rest of
this file.

## Two jobs

**Edit (default).** The user shares a draft to fix. Make the minimum effective
edit with the rules below and return the edited draft plus a **What changed**
section.

**Detect.** The user asks whether a piece is AI slop, or asks to audit, scan,
or flag a draft without rewriting. Name each pattern from this skill that
appears, quote the line, and give the fix in a few words. Do not rewrite,
score the draft, or guess whether AI wrote it. AI detectors guess. Named
patterns are evidence the user can check. Offer to edit the draft after.

Detect mode does not produce a number. Scoring belongs to
`seo-writing-framework`, which needs a stopping condition for its revision
loop. This skill's job is evidence, not a grade.

## What to ask for

If the user has not provided a draft, ask them to paste it or give a path.

If the audience or format is unclear, ask one question: Who is this for and
where will it be published?

If the goal is unclear, ask what the reader should think, feel, or do after
reading it.

## Register

Two registers, and they take different rules. Decide which one applies before
editing. If the calling skill passed a register, use it. If it's ambiguous,
ask.

**Persuasive**: landing pages, launch emails, marketing copy, headlines,
comparison pages. The reader has not yet decided to care. Curiosity gaps and a
memorable ending are allowed here, within the limits in "Patterns to cut."

**Explanatory**: docs, support replies, changelogs, pricing and policy
emails, technical posts, announcements of changes. The reader already has a
question and wants it answered. No curiosity gaps, no kicker. End on the last
concrete point or the next action.

Everything under "Words to cut" and every hard ban in "Patterns to cut" applies
in both registers.

## Editing principles

- **Preserve the writer's real voice.** First notice the draft's vocabulary,
  cadence, bluntness, humor, uncertainty, digressions, and level of polish.
  Keep the traits that feel personal to the writer. Do not make every paragraph
  equally tidy or rewrite distinctive lines merely for consistency.
- **Make the minimum effective edit.** Fix AI patterns, errors, repetition, and
  unclear passages. Leave strong human sentences alone. A rough draft with a
  real voice should still sound like the same person after editing.
- **Cut proportionally.** Remove what doesn't earn its place. A bloated first
  draft often loses 30% and reads better; a tight draft loses almost nothing.
  Thirty percent is a typical yield, never a quota. Do not cut character to hit
  a number.
- **Lead with the point when the setup adds nothing.** Cut generic
  throat-clearing. Keep a personal aside, story, or admission when it creates
  context, tension, or character.
- **Front-load only when it improves clarity.** Put conclusions early when that
  helps the reader. Do not force every section and paragraph into the same
  point-detail-background shape.
- **Keep the user's meaning.** Don't invent claims, examples, stats, or
  opinions. If something is unclear, ask.
- **Open it up, don't dumb it down.** Keep the substance, nuance, and
  precision. Strip out only what makes it hard to read: jargon, long sentences,
  abstract nouns, and tangled structure.
- **Use active voice.** "The team shipped it Tuesday" beats "the decision
  emerged." Never let inanimate things do human verbs.
- **Make every sentence earn its place.** Cut empty qualifiers and
  throat-clearing. Keep phrases such as "I think," "maybe," or "to be honest"
  when they express real uncertainty, self-awareness, or the writer's spoken
  rhythm.
- **Untangle sentences without flattening the cadence.** Split sentences and
  paragraphs when they are genuinely hard to follow. Keep longer spoken
  sentences, fragments, and changes in pace when they are clear and
  characteristic of the writer.
- **Be concrete and specific.** Abstraction is where writing goes to die. "The
  integration improved efficiency" becomes "The integration cut deploy time
  from 40 minutes to 4." Names, numbers, dates, mechanisms, and examples beat
  abstractions.
- **Use the portability test.** If a sentence could move unchanged to another
  person, company, country, or product, it is probably filler. Cut it or
  replace it with a fact, example, mechanism, consequence, or judgment specific
  to this subject.
- **Always show, don't tell the reader what to think.** Make facts, actions,
  examples, and consequences carry the emphasis. Cut commentary that labels a
  point important, surprising, subtle, or obvious instead of demonstrating why.
  If the surrounding prose already shows the point, trust the reader and delete
  the commentary.
- **Protect the specific fact.** Don't smooth a useful detail into generic
  importance. "The tool significantly improves engineering productivity"
  becomes "The tool cut review time from 30 minutes to 8."
- **Make verbs do the work.** Replace weak verb phrases with direct verbs.
  "Made a decision" becomes "decided." "Has the ability to" becomes "can."
- **Know the job.** Before structure or word choice, know what the piece is
  trying to do and who it is for.
- **Preserve useful edge and character.** Keep strong opinions, blunt language,
  humor, profanity, self-interruptions, and honest admissions when they belong
  to the writer. Don't replace them with safer or more professional wording.
- **Keep structure unless it's hurting the piece.** Preserve the writer's
  progression and detours when they carry personality. If you reorganize, say
  why in the What changed section.

## Words to cut

Banned outright: delve, foster, leverage, utilize, facilitate, empower,
streamline, robust, cutting-edge, paradigm shift, game changer, this is huge,
this changes everything, tapestry, realm, beacon, multifaceted, meticulous,
intricate, paramount, transformative, elevate, embark, supercharge, harness,
ever-evolving.

Generic enthusiasm: exciting, thrilled, delighted, game-changing. Say what
changed and why it matters instead.

Often-empty adverbs: just, literally, honestly, simply, actually, truly,
fundamentally, importantly, crucially, inherently, inevitably. Cut them when
they add nothing. Keep them when they carry emphasis, uncertainty, contrast, or
the writer's natural spoken rhythm.

Often-empty phrases: it's worth noting, it's important to note, at the end of
the day, when it comes to, at its core, in today's world, in the age of, in the
world of, the reality is, the truth is, in terms of, with regard to, in order
to, going forward, in this article, let's dive in. Cut them when they delay the
point. Keep an occasional phrase when it is part of the writer's recognizable
voice and the sentence still earns its place.

## Patterns to cut

**Binary contrasts.** "This is not X. It's Y." / "The question isn't X, it's
Y." / "It's not just X but Y." State Y directly. "The question isn't the model.
It's the eval." becomes "The eval matters more than the model."

**Throat-clearing openers.** "Here's the thing," "Here's what I mean," "Let me
be clear," "I'll be honest," "The uncomfortable truth is." Cut them and state
the point.

**Faux-insight setups.** "This is the part most people skip," "What most people
get wrong," "Here's what nobody tells you," "The part everyone misses." These
flatter the writer as the lone expert. Cut the setup and make the claim stand
on its own. "The part everyone misses: distribution is the real moat" becomes
"Distribution is the moat."

**Colon reveals.** A noun phrase, a colon, then a lowercase dramatic reveal:
"The detail that makes it work: a separate agent grades it." "The best part: it
learns." Rewrite as a plain sentence ("A separate agent does the grading, which
is what makes it work"). Use colons for lists, labels, and quotes, not fake
drama. Prefer sentence case after a colon unless grammar, a proper noun, a
title, or code requires otherwise.

**Superficial analysis.** Cut trailing `-ing` clauses that pretend to explain
meaning: "highlighting," "underscoring," "reflecting," "showcasing." "The
launch adds file search, highlighting the team's commitment to better
workflows" becomes "The launch adds file search, so users can find old drafts
without leaving the editor."

**Importance puffery.** "Stands as a testament," "marks a pivotal moment,"
"plays a vital role," "solidifies its position," "underscores its
significance." State the fact and let the reader judge whether it matters. "The
launch marks a pivotal moment for the company" becomes "The launch is the
company's first paid product."

**Interpretive metadiscourse.** Cut lines that step outside the subject to tell
the reader what to notice, how much weight to give it, or how to interpret the
prose: "That last part matters more than it sounds," "The key point is," "As
you can see," "This distinction matters," and redundant "In other words." If
the point is clear, delete the aside. Otherwise, replace it with support or
facts already in the content.

**Weasel attribution.** "Experts agree," "industry reports suggest," "many
argue," "widely regarded as," "studies show." Name the source or cut the claim.
If the user has no source, ask instead of inventing one.

**Fake-strong verbs.** Prefer "is" and "has" when they are clearer. "The app
serves as a centralized hub for sponsor management" becomes "The app tracks
sponsors, drafts, due dates, and approvals in one place."

**Synonym cycling.** If the clear word is right, repeat it. Don't rotate terms
for style. "The agent reviews the draft. The assistant scores the piece. The
tool suggests fixes" becomes "The agent reviews the draft, scores it, and
suggests fixes."

**Negative listing.** "Not a X. Not a Y. A Z." Just say Z.

**Dramatic fragmentation.** "X. And Y. And Z." or "That's it. That's the whole
thing." Use complete sentences. Vary sentence length by all means, but never
stack three or more fragments in a row.

**Robotic rhythm.** Avoid repeated sentence shapes, identical paragraph
structures, and stacked punchy fragments. Vary the shape only when it helps the
point.

**Rhetorical setups.** "What if I told you...", "Think about it:", "Plot
twist:", and self-answered "Question? Answer." pairs. Drop them and make the
point.

**Curiosity gaps.** "But that's not even the best part." Banned outright in
explanatory copy. In persuasive copy, at most two per page, each one answered
on the same page, and never phrased as a faux-insight setup. A gap you don't
close is a bait line.

**Fake-profound kickers.** Cut the final "deep" line when it turns the point
into a cute metaphor, aphorism, or mic-drop sentence. Do not rewrite it into a
better metaphor. Do not preserve the rhythm. Delete it, then end on the
clearest concrete sentence already in the draft. In persuasive copy a
deliberate ending is still allowed, but it has to be concrete: a callback to a
specific thing named earlier, a result, or an action. In explanatory copy, end
on the last concrete point or the next action.

**Summary-recap endings.** "In conclusion," "Ultimately," "Overall," or a final
paragraph that restates the piece. The reader was just there. End on the last
concrete point, takeaway, or next action instead.

**Formatting slop.** Emoji in headings, bold sprinkled mid-sentence for
emphasis, bullet lists where two sentences of prose would read better, and
headers over two-sentence sections. Format should follow the content, not
decorate it.

**Em dashes.** Do not use them as a default rhythm crutch. In short copy, use
none. In longer drafts, 1-2 are fine if they clearly beat commas, periods, or
parentheses. Remove clusters and decorative dashes.

## Workflow

1. Read the full draft before editing. If there isn't one, see "First: is there
   a draft yet?" above.
2. Establish the register (persuasive or explanatory) and the audience.
3. Identify the core point and 3-5 voice signals to preserve, such as
   vocabulary, cadence, bluntness, humor, uncertainty, or digressions. Keep
   this note internal. If you cannot identify the core point, ask the user.
4. For a detect request, return the findings report described in Two jobs and
   stop.
5. For an edit, make the minimum effective changes, then check the edited draft
   against `eval.md`.
6. If any check fails, fix the draft and run the checks again.
7. Output the full edited draft and a short **What changed** section.

## Relationship to the other copy skills

`seo-writing-framework` owns the process (research, draft, reader hat, edit,
slop gate, score) and the 0-10 rubric. This skill owns the line: which words,
which sentence shapes, which patterns. The framework calls it at step 5, before
scoring.

The split is what makes routing work. A deliverable that doesn't exist yet
needs the process, because no line-level rule fixes a draft written from
nothing. A draft that already exists needs this pass, whether or not it came
through the framework. Anything short and internal needs only this skill.
